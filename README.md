6/23/13 - Test commit - BWD
8/1/13 - Committed data, analysis - BWD
10/3/13 - Committed first stab at introduction. Missing background on Russian. Has high level overview, discussion of background on processing gap-filler depdendencies. - BWD
10/3/13 - Threw in ideas for follow-up experiment inspired during the course of writing. - BWD
5/20/14 - Committed revised introduction. Numerical issues due to update of lme4 crept in (some of the maximal models in post-critical regions no longer converge). Perhaps we should move to rmANOVAs with F1/F2? - BWD
